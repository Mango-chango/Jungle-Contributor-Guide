# Contribution Guidelines

## Repositories

Jungle's Project Repositories are divided into:

1. [Infrastructure Repository](https://github.com/Mango-chango/Jungle-Infrastructure)
2. [Backend and Frontend Mono Repository](https://github.com/Mango-chango/Jungle-Contributor-Guide)
3. [Documentation/Wiki Repository](https://github.com/Mango-chango/Jungle-Contributor-Guide)

If you don't have access to this repos you can contact you're immediate Manager, instructions to build and start your local environment can be found in each repository README file.

## Branching Strategy

We stick as much a possible to the Gitflow Workflow:

- **master branch:** is the one that is deployed to production

- **dev branch:** is the QA branch, it's the one deployed to qa/dev server and contains features that are going to be released to production

- **feature branch:** for each new task a feature branch is created from dev branch and its merged back to dev branch when the work is done

- **bug-fix branch:** (when the fix is going to come with all the features in the normal sprint release), bug-fix branches are created from dev branch and its merged back to dev branch when the work is done

- **hot-fix branch:** (when the fix needs to be populated to production quickly and can't wait to the standard sprint release), hot-fix branches are created from master, when the work is done it's merged back to master and also to dev

## Repository Best Practices

- Write comprehensive and robust tests that cover the changes you've made in your work.
- Follow the appropriate code style standards for the language and framework you're using.
- Write readable code – keep functions small and modular and name variables descriptively.
- Document your code thoroughly.
- Make sure all the existing tests pass.
- User-facing code should support the following browsers:
  - Chrome (Webkit-Blink / 22+)
  - Firefox (Gecko / 28+)
  - Edge (Chromium based / 12+)
  - Opera (Chromium-Blink / 12.1+)
  - Safari (Apple’s Webkit / 7+)
  - IE 11 (Trident)

## Pull Request Guidelines

In order to create a new Pull Request to merge your changes you have to follow this instructions:

1. Make A branch
  
    - Always create a separate branch for each ticket/user-story/issue that you're working on.
  Do not make changes directly to develop or master branch.
2. Push Your Code **ASAP**
  
    - Push your code as soon as you can. Follow the "[early and often](https://www.worklytics.co/blog/commit-early-push-often)" rule".
3. Name your Pull request

    - Name your pull request like this: [**user-story-id**]: **Brief User Story Description**
    - Then **mark the title with a "[WIP]"**
4. Describe your Pull Request
    
  - Use the following format template in your pull request:

  ````
  ### Description

  ### Screenshots (if applicable)

  ### Developer Checklist

This Pull request template has to be populated as requested, for Jungle's Frontend Repo this pull request is automatically created whenever a new Pull request is created, you only have to fill the Information and check boxes. 

## Typescript Best Practices

Typescript best coding practices will be enforced by default using [ESlint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). ESlint is a Library that helps while coding typescript to ensure the best practices are implemented in order to have:
  1. Simplicity
  2. Stability
  3. Focus
  4. Maintainability

At the moment we don't follow any practices like Clean Code, we only expect developers to follow the ESLint and Prettier rules.
